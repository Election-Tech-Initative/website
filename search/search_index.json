Depending on when they were assigned and the nature of the charges, even modest LFOs can grow out of financial control through the mandatory accrual of onerous interest charges of 12% per year or more, even while defendants are incarcerated and unable to make any payments.

Relief takes the form of developing software tools and engaging in direct advocacy on behalf of those subject to onerous LFOs to petition overseeing jurisdictions to remove or ameliorate the rulings where possible.
