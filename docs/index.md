## What is the Election Tech Initiative?

The Election Technology Initiative develops technologies for election administrators that improve confidence, participation, transparency, accessibility, and security in the election process. The Council of State Governments is administering this non-profit program and, in addition to developing educational and support materials, will work to establish its governing board and operational practices. CSG will also serve as a fiscal sponsor for managing contributions and donations.
